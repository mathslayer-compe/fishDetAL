    "This notebook performs pairwise t-tests on results from each sampling method across five random seeds of initial training data to assess whether differences between sampling methods are statistically significant. A YOLOv8n model is trained for four iterations, with 50 epochs per iteration. Before each iteration, 5% of the total training data is added to the labeled pool according to the selected sampling method. All methods start from the same initial labeled set; only the samples selected after the first iteration differ."
